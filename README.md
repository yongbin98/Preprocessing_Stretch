# Preprocessing for Stretch & Pressing Classification

## Overview

`Preprocessing_Stretch` is a MATLAB code developed for reorganizing data used in the research on the discrimination of mechanical stimuli imposed on stretchable multimodal mechanical sensor via deep learning.
'automatic_main' will automatically change the raw data to 1-cycle data.
'manual_main' helps users manually change 1-cycle data not found in 'automatic_main'.

## Features

- Automatically preprocesses and formats large datasets
- Provides easy-to-use functions for data organization and feature extraction

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later
